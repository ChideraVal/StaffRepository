Greed, pride, envy, gluttony, lust, some of the popular seven deadly sins. Today though, we'll be focusing on just one, pride.

Pride, what is it exactly? Well, it depends. I see pride as when someone sees me as inferior simply because he or she is better 
at something than I am. Some people in school see me as a proud person because of my quiet nature, basically because
I don't talk that much to people, not because I hate them, but because I'm not in the mood to talk,
(hard to believe, i knowðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚). Now, I don't see myself as proud because I don't talk to you,
but that's just how it is to them. So like I said, it depends. These are just opinions, each man to his own.

So, after knowing all these, how do we conquer pride and humble ourselves?
Well, the only and most effective way to conquer pride is to realize that..., how do I say this? Well, nobody cares. Yes, absolutely no one cares.
Seriously, pride is just a thought, a sensation that makes you believe people are thinking about you or envying you, even when they're not.
Avoid pride, it annoys God, leads to greed, envy, glttony and some other sins. A wise man once said "In your 20s, you care about what people think of you. 
In your 40s, you stop caring, and in your 60s, you realize no one was thinking about you in the first place."

So, humble yourself and have great day.
